A SIMPLE MEMORY GAME MADE USING ARDUINO:

The major circuit components include 3 LEDs (R,G,B) , 3 Buttons and an Active Buzzer.

HOW TO PLAY:
> At start, you are greeted by a welcome tone. <br />
> A single LED lights up and waits for your button response. <br />
> If you press the button corresponding to that LED you proceed to level 2. <br />
> After completing each level the game adds 1 more LED to the existing pattern. <br />
> The game ends if you enter the wrong sequence at any level! <br />
> The one who reaches level 10 successfully is the winner of the game! <br />
> GOOD LUCK! <br />

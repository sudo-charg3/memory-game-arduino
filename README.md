A SIMPLE MEMORY GAME MADE USING ARDUINO:

The major circuit components include 3 LEDs (R,G,B) , 3 Buttons and an Active Buzzer.

HOW TO PLAY?

> At start, you are greeted by a welcome tone.
> A single LED lights up and waits for your button response.
> If you press the button corresponding to that LED you proceed to level 2.
> After completing each level the game adds 1 more LED to the existing pattern.
> The game ends if you enter the wrong sequence at any level!
> The one who reaches level 10 successfully is the winner of the game!
> GOOD LUCK!

A SIMPLE MEMORY GAME MADE USING ARDUINO:

The major circuit components include 3 LEDs (R,G,B) , 3 Buttons and an Active Buzzer.

HOW TO PLAY:
> 1. At start, you are greeted by a welcome tone. <br />
> 2. A single LED lights up and waits for your button response. <br />
> 3. If you press the button corresponding to that LED you proceed to level 2. <br />
> 4. After completing each level the game adds 1 more LED to the existing pattern. <br />
> 5. The game ends if you enter the wrong sequence at any level! <br />
> 6. The one who reaches level 10 successfully is the winner of the game! <br />
> 7. GOOD LUCK! <br />
<br />
GAME FEATURES:
<br />
> Randomized Sequence of LEDS during each play
> Victory song - 'Pirates of the Carribean Theme'
> Different beeps for completing level and wrong sequence
> Improved button input (less misclicks)
